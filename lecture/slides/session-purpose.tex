\begin{frame}{Purpose of this session}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If you are new to computational science, in the spirit of iPQB,
    we will introduce you to both basic and advanced level tools and
    topics, so that you will have some basic familiarity with them
    if you end up needing to use them later.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Maybe you'll be inspired to try a computational rotation?
    \item The slides are available online on the bootcamp website
    \end{itemize}
  \item If you are already an experience programmer, we hope to introduce
    you to some tools and science-specific computer stuff that we wish
    we had known at the beginning of grad school
  \end{enumerate}
