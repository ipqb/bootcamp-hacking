  \begin{itemize}
  \item Everyone kind of does their own thing, but you should at least do something
  \item Options:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Edit a wiki page
      (\href{http://openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page}{open wetware}, 
      your lab's own internal wiki, etc.) -- Wikis aren't just for Wikipedia!
    \item IPython Notebook
    \item Evernote
    \item Google Docs
    \item A text editor
    \end{itemize}

  \item Anything works as long as you write down experiments you did,
    their result, and how to reproduce them (just like wetlab)
  \item You should hear more about this in a formal training
  \end{itemize}
