\begin{frame}{Code Review}

 \begin{itemize}

  \item For the rest of the afternoon, we're going to do a code review.

  \item The purpose of a code review is to get another person to look at your 
   code and give feedback.  Two pairs of eyes are better than one!

  \item Everyone has been assigned a partner.  Everyone should explain their 
   code to their partner and give feedback about their partner's code.  If you 
   approached the problem in different ways, talk about it and decide which 
   approach was better.

  \item Be mindful of giving constructive criticism!

 \end{itemize}
