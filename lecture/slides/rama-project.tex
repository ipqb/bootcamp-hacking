   other's solutions in groups of two.

  \item How to code review:

   \begin{itemize}

    \item Present your code to your partner.  Explain why you made the 
     decisions you made and think about any suggestions your partner has to 
     offer.

    \item Listen to your partner present their code.  Think about differences 
     between what they did and what you did, and discuss them.  Give your 
     partner any suggestions you have about their code.
